title: Evaluating article quality
summary:
content: |
  An important tool for evaluating a Wikipedia article is to look at its
  quality rating.

  Wikipedia articles are constantly being improved, and all at different rates.
  Some rival the best encyclopedias; others are out of date or incomplete.

  Volunteers will review articles and leave a rating on the Talk page. You can
  find this by clicking "Talk" at the top right of the article text.

  The best articles have been evaluated as "Good" or "Featured" articles. These
  are the best that Wikipedia has to offer, and the rating reflects a shared
  view of many Wikipedians.

  "Start" or "Stub" class articles aren't considered as reliable, or simply
  don't provide a very strong overview of the topic. These are great articles to
  work on, because there's lots you can do, and you can quickly make a dramatic
  impact.
