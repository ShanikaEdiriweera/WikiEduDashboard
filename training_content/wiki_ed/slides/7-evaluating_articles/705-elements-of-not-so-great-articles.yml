title: Elements of not-so-great articles
summary:
content: |
  You'll want to read Wikipedia critically to decide for yourself if you trust
  it. Here's some signs that the article may not be so great:

  * Are there warning banners? Often these make a statement about the article's
  reliability, though sometimes it's simply a suggestion for improvement. Make a
  note and read accordingly.
  * Are there language problems in the lead? For example, a very short lead
  might indicate that the article was written through staggered contributions,
  and could use a rewrite to tie it together.
  * Are there value statements, such as "the best" or "the most important"?
  Those are flags that it's written to persuade, or at least, not properly
  referenced.
  * Are there references to unnamed sources of information, such as "some people
  say," or "many believe"? Can you answer the question, "Who said that?"
  * Are there very few references or citations? Are the citations from good,
  reliable publishers, or are they from questionable websites or publishers with
  a clear bias?
  * Are some sections longer than others, despite being equally (or less)
  important? Are relevant sections missing completely?
