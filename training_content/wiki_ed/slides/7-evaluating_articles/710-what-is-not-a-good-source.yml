title: "What's not a good source?"
summary:
content: |
  Other sources may be tempting and easy to find, but should be avoided.

  Poor sources include:

  * Blog posts and social media
  * Press releases and promotional material
  * Official websites
  * Self-published materials

  While it can be useful to run a web search to help you find good sources (such
  as books or scholarly articles), it's usually much better to ask your librarian
  for help finding good, scholarly sources.
